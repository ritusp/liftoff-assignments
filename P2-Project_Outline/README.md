## Submission Instructions

### Overview
More advanced mathematical skills are based on an early math “foundation”—just like a house is built on a strong foundation. 
My web application will be for kids mainly for early learners. This application will help kids to improve their math skills to do even big calculations faster.
While working as an instructor, I saw many young kids struggling with numbers. Result was crying, didn't want to do math, spending time in the bathroom....  As most of the kids like to work on electronics, I thought of this application to speed up their math skills.
